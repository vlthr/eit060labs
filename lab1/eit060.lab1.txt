Problem 1: Ctrl+Alt+Delete - the trusted key sequence
Problem 2: Yes, in case it is being spoofed.
Problem 3: EIT060rUI3z!, LoooooooongP4ssw0rd+, B4dPwd!
Problem 4: Aftonbladet: journalist/Qval1t3t!
Problem 5: Not really - at best IE offers security by obscurity. Probably just fools the user into thinking passwords are safe.

Problem 6: Found all lm LM passwords with rainbow tables, but none with dictionary attacks
 
 6/14 Non-LM hashes cracked with non-case permuting dictionary attack. All long words, slightly modified or reversed.
 
 Problem 8: 4la70bfF%3n_=JmK!Lj,sf
 Problem 9: 1.2*10|17 years using 16 character passwords with upper/lower/alphas/common symbols
 Problem 10: MS-CACHEv2 brute force would take 5*10^21
 Problem 11: The salt is not secret, but if it it is too predictable rainbow tables can be built specifically for that salt. Example: Make rainbow tables for the user Administrator. Also, why not just generate a random string?

Problem 12:
33764 MH/s
Problem 13:
SVh4s01
Zi6o4aD
Problem 14:
442.2kH/s
Problem 15: Lina52 is owner, 

ALLOW Authenticated Users (all but full and special permissions)
ALLOW SYSTEM (all but special permissions)
ALLOW Administrators (all but special permissions)
ALLOW Users (read&exec, list, read)

Problem 16: Everybody, but read only.
Problem 17: Nope. Windows processes the ACE's from start to finish and the deny locks us out immediately.
Problem 18: We gave them full control, which they could use, including to change permissions and owner.
Problem 19: Works!
Problem 20: Same as parent folder
Problem 21: Both samba and security permissions must allow permissions
Problem 22: Possibly because not all failed logins are malicious. What is lina51 just typo'd?
